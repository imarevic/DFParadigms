Now you will perform another memory test for the same word pairs.
In this memory test you will be presented with the first word of a pair

The first word of the pair will appear on the left side of the screen
and you have to recall the corresponding word and type it on the keyboard.

After you have typed a word, please press RETURN.
Then the next first word of a pair will be presented to you.

If you are unable to recall the second word for a given pair, just

Continue with RETURN.
