Now we would like to ask you to remember as many word pairs
as possible. If you can remember only one word of the pair then please
type in only that word.

Even though you were told to forget the word pairs that were
followed by a forget instruction (**FFF**), we now want you to
try to remember these word pairs as well.

Please try to remember as many word pairs as possible,
regardless of the type of memory cue that followed the pair (**RRR** or **FFF**).

The order in which you recall the pairs is up to you.

You will be given 2 minutes for this recall task.

Continue with RETURN.
