In this study we want to investigate how people
remember information that they have previously learned.

Specifically, we want to find out if ones memory is better
when remembering only information that is relevant.

To this aim you will study a series of word pairs.
In a final memory test, however, your memory for 
only some of the word pairs will be assessed.
After each word pair presentation, you will be instructed whether
you have to remember that pair for a later memory test or not.

Thus, your task is to remember some of the word pairs and forget others
