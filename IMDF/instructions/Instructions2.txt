Always try to remember both words of the pair.
The word pairs that you will study will be presented in the middle 
of the screen for 5 seconds. Following each presentation you will receive 
a cue which indicates whether you have to remember the previously studied
pair or not.

A **RRR** cue means that you HAVE TO remember the previous word pair.
Your memory for these word pairs WILL be assessed in a final memory test.

A **FFF** cue means that you DO NOT have to remember the previous word pair.
Your memory for these word pairs will NOT be assessed in a final memory test.

As you will study a lot of word pairs, it will be very difficult to remember
all of the pairs. Thus, forgetting the **FFF** pairs as quickly as possibel
can be great advatage when remembering the **RRR** pairs.
